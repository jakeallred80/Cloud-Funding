Cloud-Funding
=============

Cloudfunding.mobi, cloudfundingexchange.com


The idea behind Cloudfunding.mobi is to allow users to quickly "sift" through one-page project profiles which have been reviewed, selected for publishing and awarded 1-5 stars by an authorized Cloud Fund Advisor, LLC supervisory seal. 

Initial users should be invited to log in by using social media in addition to creating a new account. (Google+, Foursquare, VentureBeat, HedgeCo, Fast Company, Entrepreneur Magazine, Business Plan Pro and other methods should be added according to user preferences and 3rd party contracts). 

Once initial users are logged in, they should be greeted with Cloud Canvass... a project submission page designed to encourage brainstorming sessions). 

Investors wishing to bypass Cloud Canvass should then be greeted by our top 5 most popular active project campaigns. Investors should then be allowed to quickly "swipe" through these one page profiles (swipe left to discard, right to add the item to thier watchlist) or use the menu tab to navigate.

All users will be granted access to the donation/rewards crowdfunding portal at no charge. 

Individuals wishing to engage in the equity and lending transactions portal will be prompted to complete an accredited investor verification form. Individuals who complete and submit the form will then be granted a 60-day investor account subscribtion at no charge and allowed to make contribution/investment pledges which will be not be made effective until the information which they provide on the Accredited Investor Verificatio form has been received, reviewed, filtered and verified on a recorded line.
